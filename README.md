## 📖 Project Experience

**Dylan's Adventure** holds a special place in my portfolio as it was my **first group project**. I worked as the **main programmer** during the three-month development cycle, and it taught me valuable lessons in collaboration, project structure, and advanced Unreal Engine workflows.

Key things I learned and contributed:
- **C++ Enemy AI**: My biggest challenge was creating functional and responsive AI using C++ — something I had never tackled before. I gained a deeper understanding of Unreal’s behavior systems and class architecture.
- **Shop & Currency System**: I developed an in-game shop and a **coin-based economy**, allowing players to collect and spend coins.
- **Ambient Sound & History System**: I implemented background sounds to enhance immersion and built a narrative system to deliver story moments throughout the game.
- **Epic Marketplace Integration**: I worked with various Marketplace assets and learned how to properly import, customize, and optimize them within Unreal Engine.

Although the game is short, it gave me hands-on experience starting and finishing a complete adventure game — and taught me how to bring different game systems together into one cohesive experience.

Enjoy exploring the project! 🎮🏝️✨
